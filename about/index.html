        <h2>¡Howdy!</h2>
        <p>
            I'm Oleg. For the past few years I’ve worked in the field of Research and Data Analytics. My background is diverse (you could say I'm a specialized generalist), but always close to digital technology. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I'm mostly passionate about 
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>technology (computer and data science, functional programming)
            <li>psychology (mental health, REBT, CBT, behaviorism)
            <li>productivity (GTD, zettelkasten, agile practices)
            <li>art (music, cinematography, literature, visual arts)
        </ul>
        <p>
            I love data, UN*X, Lisp, GNU Emacs, FOSS, cognitive science, design, HIIT and good old jazz.
        </p>
        <p>
            I working in agile teams (mostly) - where work is a way to solve problems, and not a mean by itself. I strongly agree, that Agile is not a method, but a way of thinking.
